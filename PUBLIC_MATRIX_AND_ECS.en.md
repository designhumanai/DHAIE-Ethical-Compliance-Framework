## 🌀 Philosophical Foundation: The Two Spirals of DHAIE

**Creative Spiral** — a meta-principle of co-creation and ascending evolution of human-AI interaction.

**Positive Spiral** — a mechanism of self-sustaining growth of good, knowledge, and effectiveness, implemented through 8 operational principles.

---

## 📊 ECS Formula

```text
ECS = (Σ Principles Scores / 24) × 100%
```

*8 operational principles, 0-3 points each*

**Scoring scale:**
- `0` — absent
- `1` — partially implemented
- `2` — implemented
- `3` — optimized

**Example:**

| Metric               | Value                    | Level  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------ |
| Points per principle | [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2] | 14/24  |
| Sum / ECS            | 14 / 58%                 | Bronze |

## 🏛 8 Operational Principles

Each principle implements the Positive Spiral through specific self-sustaining growth mechanisms.

| # | Principle | Focus Area | Key KPI | Implements the spiral through |
|---|-----------|------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | **Active Partnership & Continuous Consent** | Subject rights & consent | `Time to Consent <24h`<br/>`Engagement Rate >60%` | Mutual learning between human and AI, where each consent request becomes a step toward deeper mutual understanding |
| 2 | **Ethics as Architectural Advantage** | Technical safeguards | `Ethical Path Friction ≤2 clicks`<br/>`Architecture Compliance >95%` | Built-in ethical mechanisms where each honest action simplifies the next |
| 3 | **Supportive Governance Ecosystem** | Oversight & accountability | `NEC Consultation ≥4/year`<br/>`NEC Innovation ≥8/year` | "Yes, and..." principle — each NEC consultation generates new growth opportunities |
| 4 | **Proactivity & Co-evolution** | Risk management | `Stress Test Frequency ≥2/year`<br/>`Proactive Detection >70%` | Ethical stress tests opening new development directions |
| 5 | **Transparency as Collective Learning** | Openness & communication | `Pattern Library Size ≥20`<br/>`Decision Traceability 100%` | Solution pattern library where each publication enriches collective knowledge |
| 6 | **Data as Trust Investment** | Privacy & security | `Data Minimization ≤1.2`<br/>`Encryption Coverage 100%` | Privacy-by-design, where data protection becomes the foundation of cooperation |
| 7 | **Socio-Economic Ecology** | Systemic impact | `Cognitive Gini <0.45`<br/>`Public Good Investment ≥20%` | Value distribution analysis (DIA) creating cycles of mutual reinforcement |
| 8 | **International Standards Compliance** | Harmonization & audit | `Standards Compliance ≥85%`<br/>`Audit Readiness ≥80%` | Harmonization with global norms, simplifying international cooperation |

## 🎯 7 Core DHAIE Principles

Operational principles are based on the philosophical foundation of 7 core principles:

1. **Humanity** — AI serves human well-being
2. **Sustainability** — long-term preservation of values and functions
3. **Collaboration** — joint development of human, AI, and society
4. **Innovation** — development within a humanistic framework
5. **Justice** — accounting for diversity of human perspectives
6. **Positive Spiral** — mechanism of self-sustaining growth
7. **Creative Spiral** — meta-principle of co-creation and evolution

## 📋 ECS Assessment Matrix

### Scoring Guide

For each of the 8 operational principles:

**0 points — Absent:**
- No formal processes
- No documentation
- No responsible parties

**1 point — Partial:**
- Basic processes exist
- Irregular execution
- No monitoring

**2 points — Implemented:**
- Systematic processes
- Regular execution
- Basic monitoring

**3 points — Optimized:**
- Automated processes
- Proactive improvement
- Full monitoring and KPI

---

## 🛤 Certification Pathway

1. **Self-Assessment** 
   - Calculate ECS across 8 operational principles
   - Use 0-3 point scale for each principle
   - Maximum: 24 points = 100% ECS

2. **Documentation** 
   - Prepare evidence for each principle
   - Document KPIs and metrics
   - Collect examples of spiral implementation

3. **Audit Request** 
   - Submit documentation to accredited auditor
   - Provide system access for verification
   - Complete team interviews

4. **Certification** 
   - Receive compliance level (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
   - Receive official ECS score
   - Use certification badge

*Full audit guidelines: see `AUDIT_GUIDELINES_v1.0.md`*

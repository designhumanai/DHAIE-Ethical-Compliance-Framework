# DHAIE ETHICAL COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK  
*(Practical Tool for Measuring and Growing Ethical Compliance)*

> **Purpose:**  
This repository contains the official graduated compliance system for ethical cognitive modeling, developed within the Design Human AI Engineering & Enhancement (DHAIE) project, based on the **8 operational DHAIE principles** from the [Ethical Framework Protocol](https://github.com/designhumanai/DHAIE-Ethical-Compliance-Framework/tree/main/DHAIE-Ethical-Framework-Protocol.en.md).

## 🗺️ Navigation Through the DHAIE Ecosystem

| Document | Purpose | Target Audience |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| [**DHAIE Ethical Principles**](https://github.com/designhumanai/design-human-ai/blob/main/docs/ethics.en.md) | Philosophy and 7 principles (extract from 131 pages) | All roles: introduction to the approach |

| [**Full Memorandum v2.8**](https://designhumanai.com/ethics/dhaie_ethics.en.pdf) | Detailed mechanisms (131 pages) | Deep dive |

**Recommended Path:**
1. Start with [ethical principles](https://github.com/designhumanai/design-human-ai/blob/main/docs/ethics.en.md) (15 min)
2. Use this Framework to measure progress
3. Study the [Ethical Framework Protocol](https://github.com/designhumanai/DHAIE-Ethical-Compliance-Framework/tree/main/DHAIE-Ethical-Framework-Protocol.en.md) for implementation details

## 🎯 What is ECS and How Does It Work?

**Ethical Compliance Score (ECS)** measures organizational compliance with the **8 operational DHAIE principles**:

### 8 Operational Principles (from Ethical Framework Protocol):

1. **Active Partnership and Continuous Consent**  
2. **Ethics as Architectural Advantage**  
3. **Ecosystem of Supportive Governance**  
4. **Proactivity and Co-evolution**  
5. **Transparency as Collective Learning**  
6. **Data as Trust Investment**  
7. **Socio-Economic Ecology**  
8. **International Standards Compliance**  

### ECS Formula:

```text
ECS = (Σ points across 8 principles / 24) × 100%
```

**Assessment of each principle:** 0–3 points  
**Maximum:** 8 × 3 = 24 points = 100% ECS

## 🟢 Compliance Levels

| Level | ECS Range | Color | Status |
|---------|-----------|------|---------|
| 💎 PLATINUM | 90–100 | 🟢 | Exemplary compliance |
| 🥇 GOLD | 75–89 | 🟡 | Recommended improvements |
| 🥈 SILVER | 60–74 | 🟠 | Attention required |
| 🥉 BRONZE | 40–59 | 🔴 | Critical review |
| ⚠️ NEEDS WORK | 0–39 | 🔴 | Non-compliant |

## 📊 Practical Example

### "TechCorp" Company — Journey from Bronze to Gold in 18 Months

#### **Start (ECS 35%)**

```
Principle 1 (Partnership):      1/3 — basic consent exists
Principle 2 (Architecture):     1/3 — manual checks
Principle 3 (Governance):       0/3 — IEC not established
Principle 4 (Proactivity):      1/3 — incident response
Principle 5 (Transparency):     2/3 — internal logs
Principle 6 (Data):             2/3 — basic encryption
Principle 7 (Socio-economic):   0/3 — not measured
Principle 8 (Standards):        1/3 — partial compliance
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: 8/24 = 33% → NEEDS WORK
```

#### **After 18 Months (ECS 79%)**

```
Principle 1: 3/3 — real-time subject verification
Principle 2: 3/3 — presuppositional filters embedded
Principle 3: 2/3 — IEC operational, but limited integration
Principle 4: 3/3 — annual ethical stress tests
Principle 5: 3/3 — public reports, pattern library
Principle 6: 3/3 — zero-knowledge proof, data minimization
Principle 7: 1/3 — DIA conducted, but no accessibility quotas yet
Principle 8: 2/3 — compliance with major standards
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: 19/24 = 79% → GOLD
```

#### **Key Growth Enablers:**

✅ Implemented architectural guarantees (presuppositional filters)  
✅ Established Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  
✅ Launched transparency portal with public reports  
✅ Initiated regular socio-economic impact assessments (DIA)  
✅ Implemented dynamic subject consent system 
✅ Achieved international standards compliance

**Progress Path:** NEEDS WORK (33%) → BRONZE (52%) → SILVER (67%) → GOLD (79%)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### How to Assess Your Organization's ECS:

1. **Study the 8 operational principles** in the [Ethical Framework Protocol](https://github.com/designhumanai/DHAIE-Ethical-Compliance-Framework/tree/main/DHAIE-Ethical-Framework-Protocol.en.md).
2. **Assess each principle** on a 0-3 scale:
   - **0 points** — principle not implemented
   - **1 point** — basic implementation (minimum requirements)
   - **2 points** — systematic implementation (proactive management)
   - **3 points** — advanced implementation (industry leadership)
3. **Calculate ECS:** (sum of points / 24) × 100%
4. **Determine level** from the table above
5. **Build a growth plan** to the next level

### Calculation Example:

Your organization scored:
- Principle 1: 2 points
- Principle 2: 2 points
- Principle 3: 1 point
- Principle 4: 2 points
- Principle 5: 3 points
- Principle 6: 2 points
- Principle 7: 1 point
- Principle 8: 2 points

**ECS = (2+2+1+2+3+2+1+2) / 24 × 100% = 15/24 × 100% = 63%**  
**Level: 🥈 SILVER**

## 📈 Typical Growth Trajectories

### Trajectory 1: Startup → Gold (12–18 months)

```
Month 0:  ECS 35% (NEEDS WORK) — just an idea
Month 3:  ECS 48% (BRONZE) — basic consent procedures
Month 6:  ECS 62% (SILVER) — IEC established, public reporting
Month 12: ECS 78% (GOLD) — architectural guarantees working
Month 18: ECS 85% (GOLD) — sustainable ethical culture
```

### Trajectory 2: Large Corporation → Platinum (24–36 months)

```
Month 0:  ECS 55% (SILVER) — basic policies exist
Month 6:  ECS 68% (SILVER) — strengthened data governance
Month 12: ECS 77% (GOLD) — DIA implementation
Month 24: ECS 88% (GOLD) — ethics as competitive advantage
Month 36: ECS 94% (PLATINUM) — leadership in standard creation
```

## 💡 Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should ECS assessment be conducted?
**Recommended:** quarterly for internal monitoring, annually for external audit.

### Can you "skip" a level?
**Theoretically yes**, but in practice, growth requires systematic implementation of practices. We recommend sequential progression.

### What if ECS decreases?
**This is normal.** DHAIE principles evolve, requirements grow. A decrease may mean you honestly reassessed your maturity or new ethical challenges emerged.

### Is external certification required?
**Not mandatory**, but recommended for GOLD and PLATINUM levels. External audit increases stakeholder trust.
